Repository of application I am developing for guitar player Maciej Skorupa as an advertising web page / blog.

The project is rather basic and needs re-working. The code is not in line with best practice, which I intend to change, hopefully in the nearest future.

Application uses **Python** as backend language with **Django** framework.

You can see the app deployment [here](https://mskorupa.pythonanywhere.com/).
